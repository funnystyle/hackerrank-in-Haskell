Create an array of  integers, where the value of  is passed as an argument to the pre-filled function in your editor. This challenge uses a custom checker, so you can create any array of  integers. For example, if , you could return , , or any other array of equal length.

Note: Code stubs are provided for almost every language in which you must either fill in a blank (i.e., ____) or write your code in the area specified by comments.
